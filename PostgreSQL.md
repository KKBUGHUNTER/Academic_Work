To connect PostgreSQL to a Golang application on Ubuntu, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Install PostgreSQL**: If you haven't already installed PostgreSQL, you can do so using the following command:

   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
   ```

2. **Start PostgreSQL**: Start the PostgreSQL service:

   ```
   sudo service postgresql start
   ```

3. **Create a PostgreSQL User and Database**:
   You'll need to create a PostgreSQL user and a database for your Go application. You can do this using the `psql` command-line utility:

   ```
   sudo -u postgres psql
   ```

   Then, within the `psql` shell, create a new user and a database:

   ```sql
   CREATE USER myuser WITH PASSWORD 'mypassword';
   CREATE DATABASE mydb;
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mydb TO myuser;
   ```

   Replace `myuser` and `mypassword` with your desired username and password, and `mydb` with your desired database name.
   
4. **Create a Go Module**:

   If you are starting a new project, you can create a Go module by navigating to your project directory and running:

   ```bash
   go mod init myproject
   ```

   If you're working on an existing project, and it doesn't have a Go module yet, you can also initialize one in the project's root directory.

   
5. **Install the PostgreSQL Driver for Go**:
   You'll need a Go driver to connect to PostgreSQL. One popular option is `pq`. You can install it using `go get`:

   ```
   go get github.com/lib/pq
   ```

6. **Write a Go Program**:
   Here's a simple example of a Go program that connects to the PostgreSQL database and performs a basic query:

   ```go
   package main

   import (
       "database/sql"
       "fmt"
       _ "github.com/lib/pq"
   )

   func main() {
       // Connect to the PostgreSQL database
       connStr := "user=myuser dbname=mydb sslmode=disable"
       db, err := sql.Open("postgres", connStr)
       if err != nil {
           panic(err)
       }
       defer db.Close()

       // Perform a sample query
       rows, err := db.Query("SELECT * FROM your_table_name")
       if err != nil {
           panic(err)
       }
       defer rows.Close()

       // Iterate through the results
       for rows.Next() {
           var id int
           var name string
           if err := rows.Scan(&id, &name); err != nil {
               panic(err)
           }
           fmt.Printf("ID: %d, Name: %s\n", id, name)
       }
   }
   ```

   Replace `myuser`, `mydb`, and the query with your own credentials and SQL statement.

7. **Run the Go Program**:
   You can compile and run your Go program like this:

   ```
   go build your_program.go
   ./your_program
   ```

   Make sure to replace `your_program.go` with the actual filename of your Go source code.
